# GameFramework

A generic C++11 framework that can be used to as a starting point for roughly any game. I have tried to keep it as library independent as possible (save for the example classes), but there is dependency on SFML in the AudioCache which I have yet to template like ObjectManager

The idea is that you can just git clone this repo and get started straight away on making a game with all of the bare essentials done already.
